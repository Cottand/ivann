[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/icivann/ivann.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/icivann/ivann)

[Ivann](https://icivann.github.io/ivann/) is a **visual** tool for building neural networks with [PyTorch](pytorch.org), and generating code in Python in order to train and test them.

It is aimed at researchers who wish to see the bigger picture by visualising the flow behind their models. You can build through the UI by hand (Ivann aims to have the same feature set as PyTorch) and then modify the generated Python code, or build with a mixture of handwritten and generated code.
